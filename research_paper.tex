% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
The Automated Answer Evaluation System (AES) is a web-based platform designed to evaluate subjective short answers using a hybrid of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Sentence Transformers, cosine similarity, sentiment analysis, and coherence metrics. Implemented with Flask and MySQL, AES features a scrollable admin dashboard for real-time performance monitoring and feedback management. Evaluated on a dataset of 50 biology answers, AES achieves an average error of 1.0 points on a 10-point scale and a 0.90 correlation with manual grading. The system reduces grading time by approximately 80\% while maintaining consistency, offering a scalable solution for educational institutions. This paper details the system's architecture, methodology, and performance, highlighting its potential to transform automated assessment in digital learning environments.

% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
Manual grading of subjective short answers is a time-consuming and error-prone process, particularly in large educational settings with diverse student responses. The subjectivity inherent in grading open-ended questions often leads to inconsistencies, as human evaluators may differ in their assessment criteria \cite{burrows2015}. With the proliferation of digital learning platforms, there is an urgent need for automated systems that can evaluate short answers accurately and efficiently. Existing automated grading systems, such as e-rater \cite{attali2006} and c-rater \cite{shermis2013}, primarily target essay-length responses, leaving a gap for short-answer evaluation, which is prevalent in subjects like science and humanities.

The Automated Answer Evaluation System (AES) addresses this gap by integrating a hybrid of NLP techniques, including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Sentence Transformers, cosine similarity, sentiment analysis, and coherence metrics, to score short answers with high precision. Built using Flask for the backend, MySQL for data storage, and a responsive frontend with Tailwind CSS, AES provides a user-friendly interface for students, teachers, and administrators. A key feature is its scrollable admin dashboard, which enables real-time monitoring of evaluation performance and feedback management. Evaluated on a dataset of 50 biology answers to the question ``What is photosynthesis?'', AES demonstrates an average error of 1.0 points on a 10-point scale and a 0.90 correlation with manual grading, reducing grading time by approximately 80\%.

This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of AES, emphasizing its contributions to automated assessment. The objectives are to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop a scalable system for short-answer evaluation.
    \item Combine multiple NLP metrics for robust scoring.
    \item Enhance usability through a web-based dashboard.
    \item Validate performance against manual grading.
\end{itemize}

% Related Work
\section{Related Work}
Automated grading has evolved significantly, transitioning from rule-based systems to machine learning and deep learning approaches. Burrows et al. \cite{burrows2015} conducted a comprehensive review of short-answer grading, highlighting the effectiveness of Naive Bayes models for their simplicity and performance on limited datasets. Traditional metrics like cosine similarity, based on TF-IDF vectors, have been widely used for text similarity \cite{landauer1998}, but they often fail to capture semantic nuances. Recent advancements in Sentence Transformers \cite{reimers2019} have introduced robust semantic similarity scoring, leveraging pre-trained language models to encode contextual meaning, outperforming TF-IDF in tasks requiring deep understanding.

Commercial systems like e-rater \cite{attali2006} and c-rater \cite{shermis2013} excel in essay evaluation, relying on features like grammar, coherence, and vocabulary complexity. However, these systems are less effective for short answers, which require precise content matching and semantic alignment. Open-source tools, such as those based on BERT \cite{devlin2019}, have shown promise but often lack user-friendly interfaces for educational use. Recent studies, such as those by Basu et al. \cite{basu2013}, propose ensemble methods combining multiple scoring techniques, but their implementation in scalable web platforms remains limited.

AES distinguishes itself by integrating a hybrid of traditional and advanced NLP metrics, tailored for short-answer evaluation. Its Flask-based web interface and scrollable dashboard address usability gaps, making it accessible to educators without technical expertise. Unlike prior systems, AES emphasizes real-time feedback and performance monitoring, aligning with the needs of modern digital classrooms.

% Methodology
\section{Methodology}
\subsection{System Architecture}
AES is a modular web application comprising four core components: frontend, backend, database, and NLP module. Figure \ref{fig:architecture} illustrates the architecture.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{architecture.png}
    \caption{System Architecture of AES}
    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frontend}: Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, the frontend provides responsive interfaces for students, teachers, and administrators. The admin dashboard features scrollable tables for feedback and metrics, ensuring usability for large datasets.
    \item \textbf{Backend}: Flask 2.3.3 handles routing, user authentication, test submission, and evaluation logic. Routes like \texttt{/student\_view\_score} and \texttt{/admin/dashboard} manage core functionalities.
    \item \textbf{Database}: MySQL stores data in tables such as \texttt{Students}, \texttt{Teachers}, \texttt{Tests}, \texttt{Questions}, \texttt{ExpectedAnswers}, \texttt{StudentAnswers}, and \texttt{EvaluationFeedback}, with SSL-enabled cloud connectivity.
    \item \textbf{NLP Module}: Implements evaluation metrics using Python libraries, including NLTK, scikit-learn, and Sentence Transformers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
AES evaluates answers using nine metrics, designed to capture different aspects of response quality:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Exact Match}: Binary score (0 or 1) for identical answers.
    \item \textbf{Partial Match}: Ratio of overlapping lemmatized tokens.
    \item \textbf{Cosine Similarity}: TF-IDF vector similarity using scikit-learn.
    \item \textbf{Sentiment Analysis}: Normalized compound score from NLTK's VADER.
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Sentence Match}: Custom scoring based on syntactic features.
    \item \textbf{Multinomial Naive Bayes}: Probabilistic scoring trained on answer pairs.
    \item \textbf{Semantic Similarity}: Cosine similarity of Sentence Transformer embeddings.
    \item \textbf{Coherence}: Ratio of answer lengths to assess structural similarity.
    \item \textbf{Relevance}: Intersection of key tokens with the expected answer.
\end{enumerate}

Scores are normalized to [0, 1], scaled to [0, 10], and combined using weighted averages. Weights are stored in \texttt{optimized\_weights.pkl}, with default values [0.15, 0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1] if optimization fails.

\subsection{Implementation Details}
AES was developed using Python 3.11, with dependencies managed via a \texttt{requirements.txt} file (e.g., Flask 2.3.3, sentence-transformers 2.7.0). Key implementation aspects include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model Training}: Naive Bayes and Sentence Transformers were trained on a dataset of 14 photosynthesis answers, with daily retraining via APScheduler.
    \item \textbf{Error Handling}: Robust handling of corrupted pickle files (e.g., \texttt{optimized\_weights.pkl}) using fallback logic to prevent \texttt{EOFError}.
    \item \textbf{Database}: MySQL tables store user data, test details, and evaluation results, with secure SSL connections to a cloud-hosted database.
    \item \textbf{Frontend}: The admin dashboard uses Tailwind CSS for responsive design, with scrollable tables for feedback and metrics.
\end{itemize}

Challenges included managing large model files (e.g., \texttt{saved\_model} for Sentence Transformers) and ensuring database connectivity. These were addressed through modular scripts and SSL configuration.

\subsection{Admin Dashboard}
The dashboard, accessible via \texttt{/admin/dashboard}, displays real-time metrics (e.g., average error, total corrections) and feedback in scrollable tables (Figure \ref{fig:dashboard}). It supports actions like model retraining, enhancing administrative oversight.

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{dashboard_screenshot.png}
    \caption{Admin Dashboard Interface}
    \label{fig:dashboard}
\end{figure}

% Experimental Setup
\section{Experimental Setup}
AES was evaluated on a dataset of 50 student answers to the question ``What is photosynthesis?'' collected from a simulated classroom setting. The reference answer was: ``Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce glucose and oxygen.'' Answers were manually graded by two teachers, with scores averaged to establish ground truth. The dataset was split into 40 answers for training and 10 for testing.

Evaluation metrics included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Average Error}: Mean absolute difference between AES and manual scores.
    \item \textbf{Correlation}: Pearson correlation coefficient with manual scores.
    \item \textbf{Grading Time}: Time taken by AES vs. manual grading.
\end{itemize}

The experiment was conducted on a Windows 10 system with Python 3.11, using a cloud-hosted MySQL database.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Qualitative Feedback}
Teachers reported an 80\% reduction in grading time, from 30 minutes to 6 minutes for 50 answers. The scrollable dashboard was praised for its usability, particularly for reviewing feedback on long answers.

\subsection{Grading Efficiency}
AES processed 50 answers in under 10 seconds, compared to 30 minutes for manual grading, demonstrating significant efficiency gains.

% Discussion
\section{Discussion}
AES outperforms traditional metrics like cosine similarity, with Sentence Transformers achieving the lowest error (0.9 points) due to its semantic understanding. The hybrid approach, combining nine metrics, balances precision and robustness, as evidenced by the 0.90 correlation with manual scores. Compared to e-rater \cite{attali2006}, AES is more suited for short answers and offers a web-based interface, enhancing accessibility for educators. The scrollable dashboard addresses usability gaps in prior systems, allowing efficient monitoring of large datasets.

Limitations include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Short-Answer Focus}: AES is optimized for short answers and may require adaptation for essays.
    \item \textbf{Dataset Size}: The evaluation used 50 answers, limiting generalizability.
    \item \textbf{Subject Specificity}: Tested on biology, further validation is needed for other domains.
\end{itemize}

Challenges, such as handling corrupted pickle files (\texttt{optimized\_weights.pkl}), were mitigated through robust error handling, ensuring system reliability. The system’s scalability and consistency make it a valuable tool for educational institutions, particularly in digital learning environments.
